# LambdaCalc

Implementation of simple lambda calculus in Java. A successor to my [previous LC prototype](https://github.com/kyubxy/lambdabasic).

## Setup

- tl;dr, use intellij. will probably move to using a proper build system like ant later
- This project uses javacc to write the parsers

## Goals
- Simple lambda calculus parsing 
- Beta reduction with both eager and lazy evaluation
- "Function naming" with basic find and replace algorithms
- A primitive automated proofs assistant
